# Introduction
Welcome to the Society Maintenance and Notice Board App! This application is designed to simplify the process of paying maintenance fees and staying informed about important updates within your residential society.

Please note that this project is an ongoing work in progress. While it's functional and serves its core purpose, I have exciting plans to add many more features and improvements to enhance your experience.

## Data Handling and Authentication
I have implemented Firebase Firestore for robust data handling, ensuring that your society-related information is stored securely and efficiently. Additionally, our app features multi-role authentication using Firebase Authentication, allowing society members and administrators to access their respective functionalities with the appropriate level of authorization.
